- 👋 Hello, I'm @lealvjo, I've been automating since I was 14 years old, my first steps with programming were learning to automate my daily tasks, like creating a robot to download the anime episodes that I liked while I slept and so I discovered my passion for programming and robotics. Nowadays I focus my studies in the area of ​​Artificial Intelligence and machine learning with Python and test automation with Python and Java, having certificates focused on the theme. In automation I know from api's, selenium, mobile and integration of automated tests on DevOps treadmills. I have knowledge in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms, such as algorithms for autonomous cars and classification for decision making.

- 👀 I'm interested in robotics, artificial intelligence and machine learning.

- 🌱 I am currently learning artificial intelligence.

- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate in everything I can.
